 * (worker.js vs worker-gpl.js) and its WASM binary. The `new Worker(new URL(...))`

 * Niimath runs one WASM worker per instance. **Single-flight contract:** only one
 * `.run()` may be in flight per `Niimath` instance at a time — `run()` reassigns the
 * worker's single `onmessage` handler, so two overlapping runs on the same instance
 * cross-wire each other's results (the first promise can hang or resolve with the
 * wrong output). Serialize calls (await the previous `run()` before the next), or
 * create a separate `Niimath` instance per concurrent stream.
 *
 * This base class is shared by the BSD and GPL builds; the only difference is the
 * `WorkerFactory` injected via the constructor. Consumers normally use the concrete
 * `Niimath` exported from the package entry points, not this class directly.
